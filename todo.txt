book ideas
1 - sword and shield
  - an apologetics book
  - first edition contains 3 args from 4 apologetic types
  - focus on providing references to the myriad other arguments and sources
  - types = J W Wallace's super-empirical style, WL Craig's Classical Theological Style (maybe Plantiga?), Sye's pressuppositional, and RCT style from Pascal + Me
  - Maybe included, later edition, or other book = comparative religion apologetics (eg vs Islam, Mormonism, etc)
  - Evangelical techniques
  - maybe or nah = hermeneutics (moderate literalist hermeneutic)
2 - A book on policy
  - discuss left vs right, collectivism vs liberty
  - proper conservatism
  - libertarian vs anarchist vs polycentrism
  - integrating Christianity
  - a bit of history, perhaps even some conspiracyish stuff (don't trust big media because they're biased left, give data, etc)
  - contemporary applications
  - future trends, DIY libertarianism, political activism vs technological activism
